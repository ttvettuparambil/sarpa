# Product Context: SARPA

## Problem Statement

In Kerala, India, human-snake encounters are common due to the region's biodiversity and tropical climate. When people encounter snakes, they often:

1. Panic and harm the snake unnecessarily
2. Struggle to find qualified snake handlers quickly
3. Lack knowledge about whether the snake is venomous or harmless
4. Have no systematic way to report sightings for conservation purposes

These issues lead to unnecessary snake deaths, potential human injuries, and lost data for wildlife conservation efforts.

## Solution Overview

SARPA (Snake Rescue and Reporting Platform) addresses these challenges by:

1. Providing a centralized platform for reporting snake sightings
2. Connecting citizens with trained snake handlers
3. Collecting valuable data on snake species, locations, and behaviors
4. Educating users about snake identification and safety
