# Active Context: SARPA

## Current Focus

The current focus is on modernizing the frontend of the SARPA application using Tailwind CSS while maintaining all existing functionality. This includes:

1. Creating reusable components for header, footer, and alerts
2. Implementing a consistent blue and white color scheme
3. Adding dark mode support with user preference persistence
4. Ensuring responsive design across all device sizes
5. Enhancing user experience with improved form styling and feedback

## Recent Changes

### Component Structure Implementation

We've created a component-based structure for the frontend:

- `components/header.php`: Navigation, branding, and dark mode toggle
- `components/footer.php`: Site footer with contact information and links
- `components/alerts.php`: Standardized alert messages for user feedback

### Tailwind CSS Integration

- Replaced custom CSS with Tailwind utility classes
- Configured Tailwind with dark mode support
- Implemented blue and white color scheme as requested
- Added responsive design for all screen sizes

### Dark Mode Implementation

- Added dark mode toggle in the header
- Used localStorage to persist user preference
- Implemented appropriate color schemes for both modes
- Ensured all UI elements adapt properly to theme changes

### UI Improvements

- Enhanced form styling with consistent input appearance
- Improved button styling with hover and focus states
- Added visual feedback for interactive elements
- Implemented responsive tables for data display
- Enhanced chart appearance with theme-aware colors

## Current State

The following pages have been updated with the new design:

- `index.php`: Landing page with services and information
- `login.php`: User authentication with OTP flow
- `otp-verify.php`: OTP verification screen
- `user-dashboard.php`: User dashboard with statistics and sightings

The application now features:

- Consistent header and footer across all pages
- Standardized alert messaging system
- Dark mode toggle with persistent preference
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Enhanced data visualization with theme-aware charts
- Improved form validation and user feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Page Updates**:

   - Update remaining pages with the new design
   - Ensure consistent styling across all forms
   - Implement responsive design for complex data tables

2. **Enhance User Experience**:

   - Add loading states for form submissions
   - Implement smoother transitions between states
   - Improve accessibility features

3. **Optimize Performance**:

   - Minimize unused Tailwind classes
   - Optimize image loading
   - Improve JavaScript efficiency

4. **Testing**:
   - Test on various devices and browsers
   - Verify dark mode functionality
   - Ensure all features work as expected

## Active Decisions

1. **Component Approach**: Using PHP includes for components rather than a JavaScript framework to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase.

2. **Tailwind PlayCDN**: Using the Tailwind PlayCDN for rapid development, with the option to switch to a build process later for production optimization.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhancing the UI while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality.

4. **Accessibility Focus**: Ensuring color contrast and keyboard navigation work well in both light and dark modes.

5. **Mobile-First Design**: Designing for mobile first, then enhancing for larger screens.

## Current Challenges

1. **Maintaining Consistency**: Ensuring consistent styling across all pages as they are updated.

2. **Dark Mode Implementation**: Handling edge cases in dark mode, particularly with third-party components like DataTables.

3. **Form Complexity**: Some forms have complex validation and interaction patterns that need careful styling.

4. **Chart Theming**: Ensuring charts adapt properly to theme changes.

5. **Session Management UI**: Improving the user experience around session timeouts and extensions.
