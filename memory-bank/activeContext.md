# Active Context: SARPA

## Current Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the user experience and educational aspects of the SARPA application while continuing to modernize the frontend with Tailwind CSS. This includes:

1. Creating reusable components for header, footer, and alerts
2. Implementing a consistent blue and white color scheme
3. Adding dark mode support with user preference persistence
4. Ensuring responsive design across all device sizes
5. Enhancing user experience with improved form styling and feedback
6. Implementing educational video features with progress tracking
7. Adding interactive guided tours for better user onboarding

## Recent Changes

### Component Structure Implementation

We've created a component-based structure for the frontend:

- `components/header.php`: Navigation, branding, and dark mode toggle
- `components/footer.php`: Site footer with contact information and links

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Page Updates**:

   - Update remaining pages with the new design
   - Ensure consistent styling across all forms
   - Implement responsive design for complex data tables

2. **Enhance Educational Content**:

   - Add more educational videos about snake species
   - Implement a video recommendation system
   - Create a dedicated learning section

3. **Improve User Onboarding**:

   - Extend guided tours to other sections of the application
   - Create interactive tutorials for snake reporting
   - Develop contextual help tooltips

4. **Optimize Performance**:

   - Minimize unused Tailwind classes
   - Optimize image and video loading
   - Improve JavaScript efficiency

5. **Testing**:
   - Test on various devices and browsers
   - Verify dark mode functionality
   - Ensure all features work as expected

## Active Decisions

1. **Component Approach**: Using PHP includes for components rather than a JavaScript framework to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase.

2. **Tailwind PlayCDN**: Using the Tailwind PlayCDN for rapid development, with the option to switch to a build process later for production optimization.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhancing the UI while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality.

4. **Accessibility Focus**: Ensuring color contrast and keyboard navigation work well in both light and dark modes.

5. **Mobile-First Design**: Designing for mobile first, then enhancing for larger screens.

6. **Educational Focus**: Prioritizing educational content with video tracking to improve user knowledge about snakes.

## Current Challenges

1. **Maintaining Consistency**: Ensuring consistent styling across all pages as they are updated.

2. **Dark Mode Implementation**: Handling edge cases in dark mode, particularly with third-party components like DataTables and Video.js.

3. **Form Complexity**: Some forms have complex validation and interaction patterns that need careful styling.

4. **Chart Theming**: Ensuring charts adapt properly to theme changes without requiring page refresh.

5. **Video Playback Optimization**: Balancing video quality with performance, especially for users with limited bandwidth.

6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior of new features across different browsers and devices.
